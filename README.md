# SYRIA TEL ANALYSIS.

## Project Overview.
For telecommunication companies, customer churn is one of the major issues the companies are challenged by. Customer churn is the process of losing customers for a any reason at all.
This is caused by customer disatisfaction therefore leading to revenue loss as. This project aims to equip telecommunication companies with maachine learning techniques to
help predict which customer is likely to churn. This model gives great insights to the company to help retention of the customers.

### Business Problem.
Syria Tel is a company facing a level of this problem. This study seeks to address which features contribute to this challenge and provide strategoes to remedy this problem.
By gaining insights into these features, the company can make more informed decisions to enable itretain its customers.

### Data.
The dataset used for this project focuses on churn from Syrial Tel. It includes various attributes related to customer demographics, service usage and interactions with the company.
It contains 3333 rows and 21 columns.

### Objectives.
The main objective for this project is to predict customer churn using machinelearning techniques. By accurately identifying customerd at risk of leaving, we aim to enable
predictive retention strategies that will enhance customer satisfaction.

### Specific objectives.
1. Identify key factors influencing the customer churn.
   Evaluate different features to further undrestand their influence on customer churn.
2. Evaluate model performance.
   Use different classification metrics to evaluate the predictive power of the models.
3. Offer recommendations.
   Provide practical suggestions to Syria Tel to help retain their customers.

## Model Evaluation Results.
The Logistic Regression after balancing the dataset and after hypertuning had more powerful prediction power compared to the K-Nearest Neighbours.
For future prediction, the company is advised to focus more on the Customer Service Calls, International Plan, Voice Mail Plan and Total International Plan.

### Limitations.
1. The data was imbalanced and therefore had to balance the data which might not have shown its true distribution.
2. Overfitting of the KNN model- the model performed better on the training data than on the train data.
3. The use of GridSearch with cross validation is time consuming hence could not use it for more complex models.

### Recommendations.
1. For the company, se retention strategies like improving the customers' packages and regulating the charges.
2. Use better feature selection methods to reduce overfitting in the models.
